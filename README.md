# PersonalWebsite

A personal portfolio website for myself, built using [Angular v17](https://angular.dev/) and [Prime NG](https://primeng.org/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Dynamically Generated

All of the information displayed is dynamically generated from [this file](https://github.com/heckmancareer/personal_website/blob/main/src/modules/portfolio/pages/portfolio-main-page/main-page-data.ts).

## Hosting

This project is currently hosted via GitHub Pages. Since GitHub Pages does not have native SPA support, other hosting options will be considered in the future, since I would like to build further functionality
that requires direct navigation to different routes.
